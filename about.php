                    Shianglong International LTD. established in 1988 with a focus on Biomedical Engineering Institutions. Shianglong imports, manufactures, and focuses on research and development. Our company's core asset is love; we are not only investing in the company, but as well as in the men.

                    Our story begins when Mr. Li graduated with a Biomedical Engineering degree in 1976 at Chung Yuan University in Chung-Li Taiwan. As his passion grew for Biomedical Engineering, he came to America and pursued a Masterâ€™s Degree in Clinical Engineering at Polytech Institute in Worcester-MA, then worked at the University of Massachusetts for 8 years in the Medical Center. Shortly after he created Shianglong International Ltd. company.

                    Shianglong established and manufactured disposable medical gloves in 1994, in Taiwan, then expanded into Shijiazhuang City in China. In only 7 years, we became Asia's #1 in manufacturing. Our company grew even more, opening new facilities throughout China such as those plants in the city of Zibo-Shandong, Ganzhou-Jiangxi and also another plant in Taiwan, which assisted our company to become Asia's #1 in ODM facility. Shianglong has grown tremendously with our innovated team and of utilizing the GMP system.

                    We are looking for more integration opportunities to assist clients to become worldwide #1 in its industry, as well as growing them to become financially free. Our goal is to create a unique biomedical industrial park. We believe biomedical products are the best products for this century and our biomedical engineering specialist and team want to help grow this industry.
